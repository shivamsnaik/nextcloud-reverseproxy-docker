# Nextcloud with Reverse Proxy

A containerized solution to deploying Nextcloud on a server using Docker. The nextcloud service is accessed via a reverse Proxy called **Nginx Proxy**. 

It helps provide a layer of protection before the exposed services, and handles routing via the domain-name and sub-domains.
