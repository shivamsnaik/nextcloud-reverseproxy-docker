Troubleshooting:
- When initially installing Nextcloud, the data directory needs ownership of ***www-data***.
- The permissions for the root data directory should be 770.
- You need to update the trusted domains setting into the docker container, so that the nextcloud instance can be accessed through the internet without 'Untrusted Domain' error.
- For this, run the following command:
  -     docker exec --user www-data -it <container_name> php occ config:system:set trusted_domains 10 --value="nextcloud.shivamnaik.de"
- In case of nextcloud container get deleted accidentally, but the data directory is intact in the linux system,
  - Deploy a new instance of nextcloud container.
  - Create a new user.
  - Move all the files from previous accounts *files* folder to current user's 'files' folder.
  - Open a bash shell to nextcloud container using:  
    -     docker-exec -u www-data <nextcloud_container> php occ files:scan --all
  - All the files will be rescanned and added to the new nextcloud folder. Now, all your files are recovered.
